Application completed for final project for ENGINEER 1P13.
The purpose of this software is to aid people with Usher Syndrome to learn guitar chords of various songs
without the need of music sheets, braille, or external aid. By narrating every click, window change, and 
by reading out every chords in time with the beat of the song, as well as displaying them on screen, this 
program helps accommodate the deafblind. The user interface has high contrast to accommodate for colorblindness, 
as well as large fonts and buttons to accommodate for any partial blindness, and the user experience is very 
simple and intuitive. 

**LIBRARIES USED**
- Python tkinter was used for the interface.
- Pygame was used for the button interactions. 
- Json was used for file parsing and data management. 
- Pyttx3 was used for text-to-speech.
